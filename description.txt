A random side project done as a means of enjoyment alongside bigger things. Implements a Noxus and light deity boss fight based on one of the Calamity Mod's old ideas.
Don't expect other such projects. If I make more it'll be because I want to.

This mod has not been extensively tested in multiplayer. It has been programmed with it in mind but may still cause oddities.

Credits to Blockaroz and Vaikyia for boss spritework, Moonburn for custom sounds, and CDMusic for the reversed Boss Rush music.
